**<details><summary>Version 0.1.3</summary>**

 - Updated to V56.
 - Fixed sun clipping.
 - More decor Phuket & SS-13.
 - Loot table tweaks.
 - Natit fog tweaks.
 - Tweaked Natit's middle bridge path (should not be able to cross from ship side to main entrance side without ladder/jetpack/etc which is what I intended originally).
 - Renumbered 44 Valiance to 45 Valiance (44 belongs to an unreleased vanilla moon. This may require redoing your config).
 - Widened Valiance bridge some (I think it might be possible to thread the needle with the cruiser to cross the bridge but not sure I'd recommend it on this moon).
 - Fixed a hole in the hull of SS-13.
 - New landing pad texture for SS-13 (old one had a weird 3D look to it that I somehow never caught).
 - Attempted to address weird lighting on SS-13 by increasing the distance shadows are simulated.
 - Changed SS-13 terminal selection text.
 - Attempted to boost SS-13 performance by combining groups of boxes into one larger collider instead of each box having its own (not sure if this actually helps much).
 - README now includes risk level.

**<details><summary>Version 0.1.2</summary>**

 - Valiance terrain adjustments for some issues.
 - Reduced max outside map objects on Valiance to attempt to address a crash (we'll see).
 - Fixed invisible quicksand on Valiance.
 - Loot table tweaks (minor SS-13 and major Valiance. Valiance's is my first attempt at a mostly custom one and likely still needs work).
 - Increased interior weights for SS-13 (Each vanilla interior weight was 1, giving a 50-50 chance, but this could easily be overpowered by modded interiors. 50-50 remains with just vanilla interiors, and vanilla interiors have a better chance when combined with modded ones now).
